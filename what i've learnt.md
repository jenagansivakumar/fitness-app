API - The limit parameter was not being passed to the URL properly, so it meant that the search was limited to 10 results - by default. I constructed the URL manually so that now we can search for 1000 results.
Error handling - The error handler in the project catches errors that occur during API requests, ensuring that the website continues to function even if the API is temporarily unavailable or returns an error status code. While the handler currently logs the error to the console, a more robust approach could involve displaying a user-friendly message to inform visitors that the requested data is temporarily unavailable."
